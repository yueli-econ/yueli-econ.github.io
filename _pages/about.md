## Bio

Welcome! I am a PhD student in economics at University College London (UCL). I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in education, labor, and development economics. My work examines how peer interactions and social networks influence studentsâ€™ noncognitive development and socio-emotional skills. I use large-scale randomized controlled trials and survey data from schools in China to study human capital formation.

I received my MPhil in Economics degree from St Cross College, University of Oxford (2021). Before that, I graduated from Nankai University with a BSc in Economics.
