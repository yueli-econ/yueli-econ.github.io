## Bio

Welcome! I am a PhD student in economics at University College London (UCL). I work on empirical questions in development economics and the economics of education, using field experiments and social network data to study peer effects and non-cognitive development among students.

I received my MPhil in Economics degree from St Cross College, University of Oxford (2021). Before that, I graduated from Nankai University with a BSc in Economics.
