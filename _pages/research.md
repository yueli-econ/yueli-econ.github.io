### ‚ÄúNon-cognitive Development and Peer Effects: Experimental Evidence from Chinese Rural Boarding School Students‚Äù  
*with Peiyi Jin*  
[üìë Slides](/files/Noncognitive_PeerEffects_Slides.pdf)  

Abstract: This paper evaluates the direct and spillover effects of a low-cost, scalable intervention‚Äîaudio bedtime stories‚Äîon non-cognitive skill development among rural boarding school students in China. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we analyze data from 63 schools, where boarding students were exposed to bedtime stories broadcast through dormitory speakers. This design isolates treated students from untreated day students in the same classroom, allowing for robust identification of peer effects in non-cognitive skill transmission. The results show significant positive effects on treated students, with larger gains for those with day-student friends and larger friendship networks. Spillover effects on untreated day students were primarily driven by those with boarding friends, highlighting the critical role of peer networks in the transmission of non-cognitive skills. We use the characteristics of peers‚Äô peers but not direct peers to instrument peer resilience and self-esteem. Interacting with the treatment in the human capital production function, we will know how peers‚Äô outcomes affect one‚Äôs own outcome and how the treatment changes the production function.

### ‚ÄúUnemployment and Higher Education: Evidence from Higher Education Expansion in China‚Äù (2021)  

Abstract: This paper exploits the 1999 nationwide higher education expansion in China to estimate the dynamics of the causal effect of the 1999 higher education, college degrees and years of schooling on labour market outcomes in China. Using the China Urban Household Survey and China Census data and a fuzzy regression discontinuity setting, this paper finds the expansion has worsened the economic outlook for college graduates in the short run but pays back in the long run in terms of unemployment propensity, getting a good job and wages.
