**Abstract:**  
This paper evaluates the direct and spillover effects of a low-cost, scalable intervention — audio bedtime stories broadcast through dormitory speakers — on non-cognitive skill development among rural boarding school students in China. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) covering 63 schools, treated boarding students are compared with untreated day students in the same classroom to isolate peer effects. The results show significant positive effects on treated students, especially those with day-student friends and larger friendship networks. Spillovers to day students are driven by those with boarding friends, highlighting the role of peer networks. We also instrument peer resilience and self-esteem using characteristics of peers’ peers, and examine how peers’ outcomes affect one’s own outcome as well as how the treatment changes the human capital production function.
